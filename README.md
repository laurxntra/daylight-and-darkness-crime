# When the Sun Rises, Does Crime Fall?

## Overview
When we picture a crime scene, we often imagein abandoned alleyways, flickering streetlights, and police sirens. But are most crimes actually happening during the darkness?

In this project, we analyze crime data from Phoenix, Arizona to explore whether more crimes occur during the day or night. Our findings challenge common assumptions -- daylight hours see a significant amount of crime activity, sometimes even more than at night.

## Key Findings
- Larceny Theft crimes occur more frequently during the daytime
- Aggrevated Assault and Motor Vehicle Theft happen at both times, but nighttime slightly edges daytime
- Total daytime crimes surpass total night time crimes in a typical month
- Visibility and the number of people present during daytime likely influence crime rates

## Data Details
- Location: Phoenix, Arizona
- Daytime hours: 5:00 AM -- 8:00 PM
- Nighttime hours: 8:00 PM -- 5:00 AM
- Crime Types Analyzed
  - Larceny Theft
  - Motor Vehicle Theft
  - Aggravated Assault
  - Drug Offense
 
## Visualizations
We created comparative bar charts to show:
- Number of crimes committed during day vs. night for each crime type
- Overall total crimes committed during the day vs. at night

## Technologies Used
- HTML/CSS (powered by w3.css)
- Data Visualization using simple, accessible charts

## Why It Matters
Understanding when crimes are most likely to happen helps cities allocate resources, improves safety measures, and challenge public misconceptions about crime and danger
